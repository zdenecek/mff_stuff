Implement Cuckoo hash table with simple tabulation hashing.

You are given a skeleton code which defines the table, implements
`lookup()`, and provides hash functions. You have to add an `insert()`
method.

If too many elements are moved during a single insert, the table must
be rehashed with new hash functions. See lecture notes for the particular
bounds.

The size of the table should stay constant
throughout the existence of the data structure.
