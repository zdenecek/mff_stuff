# Lab Activity 01 - gRPC

Your task is to:
- Choose any language supported by gRPC https://grpc.io/docs/languages/.
- Read the tutorial for the selected language and install the required libraries.
- Create a gRPC client based on the `LabActivity` service defined in `01/protos/activity.proto`.
- Using this client, connect to our server at `lab.d3s.mff.cuni.cz:6001` (using the "insecure" channel since the server does not use SSL/TLS).
- Make sure to submit your SIS login in the RPC so that we can verify the completion of the lab activity.
- The server will return instructions to complete the assignment.
