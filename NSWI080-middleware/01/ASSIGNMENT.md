# Assignment 01 - gRPC

The assignment comprises the lab activity and three other tasks (i.e., the lab activity is also graded as part of the assignment). All tasks require that you write a client for a particular service and connect to our server. You can use any programming language with gRPC support to solve the assignment. When you complete a task, the server sends instructions to complete the following task. Start with the `LAB_ACTIVITY.md` file.

Please contact me (<pecimuth@d3s.mff.cuni.cz>) if you encounter any problems.

Once you complete all tasks, submit the scripts or programs you wrote to solve the assignment. Include a short description explaining how to run the scripts and the approach you took (e.g., did you write an async or a blocking client?).

## Submission Instructions

- Submit in your GitLab repository by commiting the necessary files and pushing the tag `done-01`.
- In your submission, please include:
    - The source code of any scripts and programs you created to solve the assignment.
    - A `SOLUTION.md` file describing how to run your scripts and how you solved the assignment (briefly in a few sentences).
- Do not submit build artifacts, executables, etc. You can submit (Jupyter) notebooks.
- You will be awarded full points if you submit the `SOLUTION.md` file and code that solves all tasks according to the instructions.
