You can find the proto file for the next task below.

syntax = "proto3";

// The goal of this task is to win a number guessing game. The server picks a
// random number between 1 and 1_000_000 (inclusive) and the client sends guesses to the server.
service GuessTheNumber {
  // Plays a number guessing game. The server responds for each guess with
  // the reason why the guess was wrong (too low, too high, etc.) or the instructions
  // for the next task if the guess was correct.
  rpc Play(stream Guess) returns (stream GuessResponse) {}
}
