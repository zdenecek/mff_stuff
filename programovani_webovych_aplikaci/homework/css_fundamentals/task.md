Create a HTML web page design using cascading style sheets. Use any HTML document(s) without styles to get you started -- e.g., take HTML you have submitted for previous assignments. Submit all files related to your solution (i.e., HTML, CSS, and images, if they are used in HTML). The files must be all stored in one directory (without any subdirectories).

The cascading style sheets have to be saved in separate files and linked from HTML documents. Do not use `<style>` element nor `style` attribute. Also do not use the CSS `@import` rule (since the ReCodEx does not recognize it).

No esthetic aspects of your solution will be judged. However, the solution must fulfill the following criteria:

-   Use CSS properties for setting up font shape (family, size, ...) and text properties (alignment, indentation, line size, ...).
-   Use CSS properties for altering the color and background color settings (not necessarily for the same element).
-   Place an image on the background of an element.
-   Use CSS properties for inner spacing (`padding`), visualizing the edges (`border`), and outer spacing (`margin`).
-   Use CSS selector which combines all three basic selectors (tag name, class, and ID).
-   Use at least one nontrivial operator for combining selectors (`>`, `~`, or `+`).
-   Use attribute filter in a CSS selector.
-   Create a simple effect which activates, when user positions the mouse cursor over the target element. For instance, change the color of hyperlinks when mouse cursor is over them (and change it back when cursor leaves the hyperlink).
-   Use a pseudo-class in a CSS selector (not the one you have used to fulfill the previous criterium).
