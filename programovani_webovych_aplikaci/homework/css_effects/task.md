Create a HTML web page design using cascading style sheets. Use any HTML document(s) without styles to get you started -- e.g., from previous assignments. Submit all files related to your solution (i.e., HTML, CSS, and images, if they are used in HTML). The files must be all stored in one directory (without any subdirectories).

The cascading style sheets have to be saved in separate files and linked from HTML documents. Do not use `<style>` element nor `style` attribute. Also do not use the CSS `@import` rule (since the ReCodEx does not recognize it).

No esthetic aspects of your solution will be judged. However, the solution must fulfill the following criteria:

-   Load a custom font and use it in the page. To simplify our verification procedure, set the identifier of the font to `myCustomFont`.
-   Use `transitions` to create an interesting visual effect. The effect should be triggered when a mouse cursor is placed over the corresponding element.
-   Use suitable 3D transformation (e.g., rotation). Do not forget to set perspective.
-   Use `:target` pseudo-class (in combination with appropriate hyperlinks) to emphasize selected part of the page (e.g., make table rows selectable and highlighted).
