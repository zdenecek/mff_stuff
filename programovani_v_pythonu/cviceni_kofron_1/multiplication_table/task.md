The goal is to create a program, which prints out a multiplication table for a number given as a program argument. E.g., for the argument 5, the program prints out:

```
 1 * 5 =  5
 2 * 5 = 10
 3 * 5 = 15
 4 * 5 = 20
 5 * 5 = 25
 6 * 5 = 30
 7 * 5 = 35
 8 * 5 = 40
 9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
```

Indentation of of the outputed numbers is not important.

The text is printed out to the standard output.

The argument is in the range of 0 and 10 and it is always set correctly, i.e., there is no need to check correctness of the input.

[OUTPUT](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/api/v1/uploaded-files/ebf25799-3387-11e9-b0fd-00505601122b/download) file contains correct output for the argument 5. If your solution is executed with the argument 5 (on a unix system, you can run it as follows: `your_file.py 5`), then your code must print out exactly the content of the [OUTPUT](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/api/v1/uploaded-files/ebf25799-3387-11e9-b0fd-00505601122b/download) file (otherwise, do not even try to submit your code).

Your solution have to be in a single file.
