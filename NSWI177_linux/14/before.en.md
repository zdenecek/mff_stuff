# Before class quiz (#14)

The quiz has to be submitted to your GitLab project before your lab starts.

Every question is worth 25 points.

Insert your answer inside the marked block (replace the ellipsis).



## Question Q1

Write here a short feedback about this course. Was it useful?
Was it too easy or too difficult? Do you think you understand some
networking or programming topics better than before attending this
course?

If you think you are unable to come up with an answer to any
of the questions above, try answering an alternate one: "if you
could change one thing about the course, what would you like to
change?" Anything from "drop the before class quizzes" over
"use zsh instead of Bash" to "have 135 instead of 90 minutes long
labs" is possible. Looking forward to your answers :-)

Select from the descriptions below the one that _best_ describes
what is continuous integration (CI).

1. Using CI means that software can be tested.

## Question Q3

Select which of the statements below are true.

1. Processes in different containers are isolated from each other
   (e.g. we cannot kill process in a different container).
2. Containers can be started by normal (non-root) users
   (assuming proper system configuration).
3. Container image can be liken to a lightweight image of a disk
   from which the container starts.
4. Alpine is a minimalistic Linux distribution.
5. Containers can access Internet (considering default configuration).
6. Containers can allocate virtually any amount of memory (RAM) but
   they can be limited if the user decides to do so.

Your answer: **[A3]** ... **[/A3]**



## Question Q4

As the very very last question for the before class quizzes, we
would like to hear from you an estimate of time you devoted to this
course.

We would like to know two things.

1. How many minutes on average you spent preparing for each class.
   This should include time needed for reading the before class text
   and also answering these quizzes.
   We are interested in an average per week (in minutes). No reasonable
   answer is wrong. But do not answer _elephant_, please ;-).

2. How many minutes you spent on the homework (graded) tasks.
   Again, we are interested in average per week (in minutes).
   Please, take into account that some tasks were rather short (like 07,
   for example) while some were a bit longer (like the combo 05-06).

Please, provide you answer as two integers without units (as they
are minutes per week) so that we can automatically process your
answers. E.g. `60 150` to say that you needed about an hour each
week to read the text and fill-in this quiz and about 2.5 hours to
complete the (mostly) scripting tasks (again average per each week).

Thank you!
