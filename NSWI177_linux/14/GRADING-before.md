For assignments with automated tests you will see a TAP-style result output
that you are familiar with from your pipeline tests in GitLab.

The tests also contains information about points assigned (or subtracted)
for that particular test. There are also tests with _zero points_ that
are informative only (kind of like warnings from your compiler: you
should pay attention but they are not crucial).

## Q1 (feedback)

**Points**: 25


## Q2 (continuous integration)

**Points**: 25

**Expected:** 4 (answered 4)


## Q3 (Containers)

**Points**: 25

**Expected:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (answered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)


## Q4 (time spent)

✅ **A4 okay** (passed, +25 points)

✅ **A4 correct format** (passed, informative only)

↷ **A4 value extraction** (skipped)



### General notes (collected from all solutions)

First of all: thanks for answering this question for us!

For those interested, here are the summary results.

We have 193 answers for this question, we suspect that some of you decided
to skip the quiz completely if you already have enough points so the results
might be skewed. The resuls are also obviously biased by the fact that only
students that have not give up at the beginning of the course provided
their answer here.

In the following summary, I decided to report medians and quantiles in general
without reporting means since the mean is heavily influenced by outliers.

|                                                  | Quizzes | Tasks |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------:|------:|
| Minimum                                          |      10 |    45 |
| 1st quartile (i.e. fastest 25% of you)           |      40 |   150 |
| Median (i.e. half of you needed less than this)  |      50 |   180 |
| 3rd quartile (i.e. not enough for 25% of you)    |      60 |   240 |
| 95th percentile (i.e. not enough for 5% of you)  |     120 |   420 |
| Maximum (see note below)                         |     180 |  1500 |

The last two lines clearly show why reporting an arithmetic mean would be
confusing here as the disproportion for the 5% is three-fold for the tasks.
