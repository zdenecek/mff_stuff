The goal of the course is to introduce basic principles of computer architecture to first year students. The course assumes no prior knowledge of computer organization and operation, and is structured in a way that students can see through the typical user view of computer behavior. Students attending the course will understand the operation of a computer from a programmerâ€™s perspective, learn how data are represented and stored in computers, understand how data is processed in computer systems, and discover the logical connections between programs and hardware.
