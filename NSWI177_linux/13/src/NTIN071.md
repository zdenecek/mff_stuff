Introductory lectures on Automata Theory and Formal Grammars. The emphasis is put on basic terminology and fundamental results. We study and highlight connections between the following formal models: finite-state and push-down automata (both deterministic and non-deterministic), Turing machines (including the halting problem), regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars.
