Physical education is required during bachelor studies. Second year students generally register for these courses in the winter semester in accordance with their recommended course of study. In place of one of the recommended courses NTVY0014, NTVY015, NTVY016 and NTVY017 it is possible to enrol in the summer training course NTVY018, or the winter training course NTVY019. Students can enrol in this course at any time during their bachelor studies. Students of MFF who have a course listed in their recommended study plan are given priority during registration.
