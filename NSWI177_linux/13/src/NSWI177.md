The goal of the course is to acquaint students with the principles of UNIX and operating systems based on GNU/Linux. The course focuses primarily on the practical aspects of working in a UNIX-like environment and basic administration tasks. The graduates are expected to be capable of installing, configuring, and (with the use of scripting) effectively using tools and services that serve as the basis of a modern software development infrastructure.
