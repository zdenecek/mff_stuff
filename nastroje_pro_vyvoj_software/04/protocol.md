Tasks
-----

0. Task 1 has three alternatives - Gradle, Autotools and CMake.
   You should pick just one based on your favorite platform and programming language.
   Alternatively, it is also possible to create the build script (using Gradle, Autotools, or CMake) for your own program with similar complexity like those provided by me.

1/Gradle: Write the build.gradle script for Gradle that mimics functionality of the script created for a previous homework (either build.xml/Ant or pom.xml/Maven).
          Make sure that everything works as expected.
          Follow the standard concepts and best practices associated with Gradle.

1. Submit all the scripts and configuration files.


-------
Survey:
-------

We use the survey to evaluate the labs (tasks) and homework assignments.
It is completely voluntary, but useful for future tuning of the content and level of complexity of the labs.
Most questions can be answered using the scale from 1 to 10.
Write your answer under the corresponding question.

(1) How new was the topic and content of the lab for you?
     (1 - brand new, 10 - I already knew everything)


(2) Do you think that the content of this lab was useful?
     (1 - useless or too trivial, 10 - very useful)


(3) How do you evaluate the level of complexity of the homework assignment?
     (1 - too trivial, 5-6 - just about right, 10 - too demanding or complex)


(4) How do you evaluate your prior experience with the tool in the context of the homework assignment?
     (1 - I already know and can use everything, 10 - I tried everything practically for the first time)


(5) How much time (in minutes) did you spend working on the homework assignment?


(6) Additional space for your own comments on the lab and homework assignment:
