# Operating System Architecture Discussion Points

These are discussion points collected throughout the lectures.
Written in considerable shorthand, use as you see fit.


## Summary So Far

- You should have some idea of what the instruction cycle of a common processor looks like
    - Processor is a simple machine that keeps fetching and executing instructions
    - You can expect some typical instructions in an instruction set
        - Moving data between registers
        - Moving data between memory and registers
        - Performing basic computation on register content
        - Directing control flow
    - You should have some idea how instructions are encoded

- You should have some idea of how high level program constructs translate to processor instructions

- You should have some idea of how input and output operations are performed through processor instructions

- You should have some idea of what the interrupts and the exceptions look like at the processor abstraction level


## Operating System Role

Topics:

    - Do we need an operating system ?
        - What roles does the operating system play ?
        - How is the operating system different from applications ?


## Operating System Architecture

Topics:

    - Program architecture vs system architecture
    - Can you draw a system architecture ?
