PHP, Slim Framework
Get ready
What you need to know:
• Handling HTTP requests in PHP, $_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER, ...
• FrontController design patterns.
Using your own computer
PHP and Composer.
Objectives
• PHP PSR-7
• Slim Framework
A "better" HTTP interfaces
The specify a way of interaction with HTTP. It is an alternative to using
HTTP wrapper ($_GET, $_POST, etc.).
is a PSR-7 compliant micro framework for PHP. To use Slim with PSR-7 we need to install
PSR-7 binding.
HTTP message interfaces
Slim
At its core, Slim is a dispatcher that receives an HTTP request, invokes an
appropriate callback routine, and returns an HTTP response. That's it.
Slim application skeleton
What are your expectations of a mature PHP web application?
Create and explore a Slim framework skeleton project.
php .\composer.phar create-project slim/slim-skeleton slim-framework-skeleton
Troubleshooting
Enable "mbstring" extension in "php.ini" file.
Problem 1
- Root composer.json requires phpunit/phpunit ^9.5.26 -> satisfiable by phpunit/phpunit[9.5.26,
..., 9.6.22].
- phpunit/phpunit[9.5.26, ..., 9.6.22] require ext-mbstring * -> it is missing from your system.
Install or enable PHP's mbstring extension.
Assignment: Slim application
GitLab: ./practical-02/
As the skeleton slim application is too big, we create a new application from scratch. There is a
useful guide. Here are the steps to follow:
• Use Slim and PSR-7 binding.
• Put into the "./public/index.php" file.
• You can start local server using in the public directory.
Rest of the assignment is structured as a "step-by-step" guide to implement the final functionality.
I would recommend you to follow it, especially if you are not sure what to do.
Get Started
composer require slim/slim:"4.*"
composer require slim/psr7
Hello world
php -S 127.0.0.1:8090
Error handling
Add error handling using middleware.
Pages
Add following pages into your application at given URLs:
• "/" - home page
• "/authors" - authors list
• "/register-author" - register an author
• "/articles" - articles list
• "/create-article" - create an article
The home page should contain some information about the application. The exact content is not
important, it just must not be empty!
For all the others you can now return just a random string to make sure it works.
Authors
At the "register an author"" page your can fill in a form. The form must contain a name input as a
text. User can submit the form using "Register" button.
The form must be submitted at the "register an author" page using POST. As a response to a POST
return HTML with message "{name}, welcome!". Where "{name}" is the value user provided. You
can get "name" from the .
The "authors list"" page should return HTTP code . The HTML should contain a message
"Coming soon!".
request POST parameters

Articles
Both article related sites, "articles list" and "create an article" should return HTTP code . The
HTML should contain a message "Coming soon!".
501
Using templates
Put all the HTML content into templates files. The template files should be located in "./template/"
directory. Create one template file per view. Use to PHP renderer render the templates.
Layout
Create a for your application. The layout must include a navigation header with links to the
all pages. In addition, it must include footer with a following copyright notice.

PHP-DI
Add and to your application.
Create a controller for each page and use .
Put controller classes into the "./src" directory. You may split more functionality into "./app" or "./
application" directory as we have seen in Slim skeleton project.
Inject the to controllers using a constructor.
PHP-DI Slim bridge
Controllers as services
PHP renderer
Deployment
Deploy your application to webik.ms.mff.cuni.cz/{your-user-name}/nswi153/practical-02.
