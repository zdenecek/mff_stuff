## My static OWL Clone

Some homework tasks for some of the courses can be found in my static OWL clone.

[The owl clone can be found here](http://owl.zdenektomis.eu/c/all.html).

## TODOs

* [ ] Add recodex to all courses
* [ ] Add link to my owl clone
* [ ] Do all TBD
* [ ] Make a pipeline to compile tex files
* [ ] Unify folder structure
* [ ] remove junk (present because I like to do git add *)
