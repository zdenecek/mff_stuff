For this purpose i used an archiso with the disk attached as sda and a second disk of size 300M attached for swapping.
/dev/sda1 is btrfs, /dev/sda2 is ext4

First i shrunk the ext4 filesystem with

> resize2fs /dev/sda2 300M

then i moved it to the other disk with dd

> dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb bs=300M

then i recreated the partitions:

> fdisk
...
delete both paritions
make new partitions, the first one must start at the same sector (easy, default 2048)
with sizes 500M and 300M

# resize btrfs

First mount it with
> mkdir mnt
> mount /dev/sda1 mount
then resize with
> btrfs filesystem resize /dev/sda1 +100M

> umount mnt 

# move ext4 back

> dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda2

# check with

> btrfs check /dev/sda1

No errors

> fsck /dev/sda2

Done

I believe no non-standard tool were used.
