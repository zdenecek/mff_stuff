I believe it were better if the homework was graded sooner after the deadline. This way I am afraid of breaking something by working on following homework and keep constantly checking if everything runs as I think it should, moreover if I do something wrong, I get to know it only three weeks later, when I already used it in three more homework assignmets.
Furthermore, I think there are too many open questions in **study** materials. The answer should either be provided or the question should be left out, it feels overwhelming this way.
There is a typo in this weeks assignment: oustide under Volumes.
