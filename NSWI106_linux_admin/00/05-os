For this subject I am using Fedora, because I had it in dual boot from last semester of Introduction to Linux.
On my VPS and in usual workflow in Windows I use Ubuntu as my distro, because I find it easier to use mainly because I can much more easily find solutions to common and uncommon problems on the internet, moreover, I find that using a touchpad on linux is hell (again, I need mouse for some web applications). 
I use Windows as my main os because there are many apps that are Windows only (e.g. for running tournaments, doing accounting) and I am used to it and its shortcuts and configuration, furthermore, one can run Linux in Windows but not Windows in Linux (at least by far not as easily and to such an easily utilizable extent)
