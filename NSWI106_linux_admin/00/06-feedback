Wording of task 02 doesn't is not clear: "Tell us what you did", there is no hint, the word password is used when ssh-keygen operates with passphare (I wasn't sure whether to set a password in a different way). In general the tasks are already not as well worded as they could be. I couldn't come to the first labs as an exception so the task wording is the only thing to work with. For example, I also had problems with task 07 - it isn't clear that the setup is for the same machines as for task 03; by just adding one more line to the assignent, it would be so much clearer. Of course, if it is intentional obfuscation then I have no case.
