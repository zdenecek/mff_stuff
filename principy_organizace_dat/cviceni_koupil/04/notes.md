I chose page capacity 3 because it the global depth was same for both 3 and for and the sum there wasn't any optimizition in choosing 4 for the given input.

I chose to split after 3 inserts because with capacity 3 the overflows are still minimal and the empty space stays around a constant.
The expected consequence is that after 20 inserts, there will be 10 pages
