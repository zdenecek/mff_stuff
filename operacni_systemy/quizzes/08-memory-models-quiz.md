# Memory Models

This is a graded quiz, do not forget to commit and push your responses in time (deadline is end of November 23).


## Course Survey

Surprise ! There is no technical quiz this week (we thought you could use a break), but you can still get your four points !
Please answer our anonymous survey about the course at https://forms.gle/TmJMJribsowxLizZ7
and then answer the following question so that we know you have earned the points:

**[Q1]** Did you answer our survey ?

**[A1]** Yes. **[/A1]**

We hope this is not too much of a bother. Doing a survey like this once in a while helps us
identify possible issues with the course that we would not hear about otherwise.
The survey is anonymous, feel free to list all your concerns (or praise :-).
We will present a brief summary of the results in case you are interested,
but will try not to distract you more this year.

(If you wonder why we do not rely on the regular student survey in SIS,
it is because that survey is not detailed enough and we do not get
the results quickly enough.)


## Ask Your Question

This time around, even the free form question is optional,
you can get the four points just for answering the survey
above. In case you still have a technical question though,
do ask :-) ...

**[Q0]** Ask a single question concerning the topic of the next self study module.

**[A0]** ... **[/A0]**
