I understand we are supposed to present our favorite tools, but I don't see this being useful for anyone in the audience, I am sorry.

Nice demo, well structured presentation.

As for "Other red head products", I am not sure it is relevant when you only show the names.

Questions to the audience -> "have you had any experience with ..." were a little too repetitive, there was little time to respond and the conclusion was drawn too quickly.

Won't grade my own slides. I don't like public speaking and it always shows, but I tried. Should have included showcase how to setup swagger UI in node.js project.
